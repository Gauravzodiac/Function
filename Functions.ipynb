        "#Data Types and Structures Questions\n",
        "1. What are data structures, and why are they important?\n",
        "  \n",
        "  -A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data efficiently. They are important because they optimize performance, improve memory usage, and help in solving complex problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types with examples.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  -In Python, mutable data types can be modified after creation, while immutable data types cannot be changed once created.\n",
        "   Example:\n",
        "   my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "   my_list[0] = 10\n",
        "   print(my_list)\n",
        "\n",
        "   Example:\n",
        "   my_str = \"Hello\"\n",
        "   my_str[0] = 'h'  \n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are the main differences between lists and tuples in Python?\n",
        "  \n",
        "  -A list is mutable, meaning it can be modified after creation, whereas a tuple is immutable, meaning it cannot be changed.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Lists use square brackets [], while tuples use parentheses (). Because tuples are immutable, they are faster and consume less memory compared to lists.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Lists have more built-in methods like append() and remove(), while tuples have only a few methods like count() and index().\n",
        "\n",
        "  Use lists when you need a dynamic structure that can be modified, and tuples when you need a fixed collection of values.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Describe how dictionaries store data.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  -Python dictionaries use a hash table to store key-value pairs efficiently. Each key is hashed to determine its memory location, allowing fast O(1) lookups.\n",
        "\n",
        "  If two keys have the same hash (collision), Python resolves it using techniques like open addressing or chaining.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Keys must be immutable, and values can be of any data type.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python?\n",
        "  \n",
        "  -You might use a set instead of a list in Python when:\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> Uniqueness is Required – A set automatically removes duplicate values.\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> Faster Lookups – Searching for an item in a set is O(1) on average, while in a list, it's O(n).\n",
        "\n",
        "  -> Efficient Set Operations – Sets support fast operations like union, intersection, and difference.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What is a string in Python, and how is it different\n",
        "   from a list?\n",
        "  \n",
        "  -String → Immutable, stores characters, uses quotes (\"Hello\").\n",
        "\n",
        "   List → Mutable, stores any data type, uses square brackets (['H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']).\n",
        "7. How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python?\n",
        "  \n",
        "  -Tuples ensure data integrity because they are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed after creation. This prevents accidental modifications, making them ideal for storing fixed or trusted data.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python?\n",
        "  \n",
        "  -A hash table stores key-value pairs using a hash function for fast lookups (O(1) on average).\n",
        "\n",
        "   Python dictionaries use hash tables internally:\n",
        "\n",
        "   ->Keys are hashed to find memory locations.\n",
        "\n",
        "   ->Values are stored at those locations.\n",
        "\n",
        "   ->Collisions are handled using techniques like open addressing or chaining.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. Can lists contain different data types in Python?\n",
        "  \n",
        "  -Yes, lists in Python can contain different data types because they are heterogeneous. A single list can hold integers, strings, floats, booleans, and even other lists or objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. Explain why strings are immutable in Python.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  -Strings are immutable because:\n",
        "\n",
        "  ->Memory Efficiency – Avoids unnecessary modifications.\n",
        "\n",
        "  ->Security & Integrity – Ensures consistency in keys (e.g., dictionaries).\n",
        "\n",
        "   ->Thread Safety – Prevents issues in multi-threaded programs.\n",
        "\n",
        "   ->Optimization – Enables string interning for better performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -Faster Lookups – O(1) vs. O(n) (dictionaries use hashing).\n",
        "\n",
        "  Key-Value Storage – More intuitive data access.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Efficient Updates – Direct access via keys.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Unique Keys – Prevents duplicates.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Better Organization – Data is structured and readable.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -If you’re working with GPS coordinates (latitude, longitude), using a tuple ensures the values remain unchanged.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. How do sets handle duplicate values in Python?\n",
        "  \n",
        "  -Python sets automatically remove duplicate values because they store only unique elements. When you add duplicate values, the set keeps only one instance.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. How does the “in” keyword work differently for lists and dictionaries?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -Difference in in Keyword for Lists vs. Dictionaries\n",
        "   Lists (O(n)) – Checks each element one by one (slow for large lists).\n",
        "\n",
        "   Dictionaries (O(1)) – Checks keys only using hashing (fast lookup).\n",
        "15. Can you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why not?\n",
        "  \n",
        "  -No, tuples are immutable, meaning their elements cannot be modified after creation.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Why?\n",
        "  Memory Efficiency – Tuples use less memory and are optimized for performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Data Integrity – Prevents accidental changes, making them safer for storing constants.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Hashability – Tuples can be used as dictionary keys, while lists cannot.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What is a nested dictionary, and give an example of its use case?\n",
        "  -A nested dictionary is a dictionary inside another dictionary, allowing hierarchical data storage.\n",
        "  Example:\n",
        "  students = {\n",
        "    \"Alice\": {\"age\": 25, \"grades\": [90, 85, 88]},\n",
        "    \"Bob\": {\"age\": 22, \"grades\": [78, 80, 82]},\n",
        "     }\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "    print(students[\"Alice\"][\"grades\"])\n",
        "\n",
        "17. Describe the time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -Time Complexity of Accessing Elements in a Dictionary.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Average Case: O(1) – Dictionary lookups are fast because they use hashing to directly find the key.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Worst Case: O(n) – Happens if hash collisions occur, requiring a search through multiple entries.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. In what situations are lists preferred over dictionaries?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -Ordered Data Storage – Lists maintain the order of elements, while dictionaries (before Python 3.7) didn’t.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Sequential Access – When data needs to be accessed by position (index-based access).\n",
        "\n",
        "  Allowing Duplicates – Lists can store duplicate values, unlike dictionaries (which require unique keys).\n",
        "\n",
        "  Simpler & Lightweight – Lists have less overhead than dictionaries, making them faster for small datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Iteration Over Values – If you only care about values, lists provide straightforward iteration.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -No Indexing – Cannot access values by position (dict[0] ❌).\n",
        "\n",
        "  Key-Based Lookup (O(1)) – Must retrieve values using keys.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Iteration Order Preserved – But internally, keys are stored via hashing.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. Explain the difference between a list and a dictionary in terms of data retrieval.\n",
        "\n",
        "  -Access Method:\n",
        "\n",
        "  ->List: Uses index-based access (O(1)).\n",
        "\n",
        "  ->Dictionary: Uses key-based access (O(1)).\n",
        "\n",
        "  -Search Speed:\n",
        "\n",
        "  ->List: Slow (O(n)) for value lookup.\n",
        "\n",
        "  ->Dictionary: Fast (O(1)) due to hashing.\n",
        "\n",
        "  -Ordering:\n",
        "\n",
        "  ->List: Maintains order.\n",
        "\n",
        "  ->Dictionary: Preserves insertion order\n",
        "\n",
